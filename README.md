## About
For the last nine years I have worked in a primary school in capacities ranging from finance,
assessment and managerial. I been interested in programming, believing it to be a means to streamline
routine work and automate mundane tasks. To this end, I have streamlined many aspects of the company
to remove human error and rapidly reduce manual processing: iZettle cURL, Stripe webhooks, XML
conversion and parsing.

In my free time, I have embarked on small side-projects to cut my teeth at maintaining codebases.
These include:

- an API for querying school Ofsted results by locality and grade
- a webapp for managing phone extensions and voicemail inboxes, using Twilio's API

I have an eye for design and am meticulous to a fault. My code is neat and my version control is


I have experience of TravisCI and StyleCI
